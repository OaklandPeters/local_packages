UPDATE: 2014/09/02
Changed: Switched to new approach
------
Short Description:
File:
	/user/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/cccid_custom_packages.pth
Contents:
	/data/htdocs/pylibs/
	/data/htdocs/pylibs/module_links/
Folders:
	(1) /data/htdocs/pylibs/
	Contains packages as hosted on Bitbucket/Github - specifically, an outer folder with metadata & build-files, and an inner folder with the Python scripts.
	A typical organization might be organized like:
		/data/htdocs/pylibs/sqlfront/
			.gitignore
			.pylintrc
			setup.py
			README.rst
			setup.py
			sqlfront/
				__init__.py
				interfaces/
					__init__.py
					...
				mysql/
					__init__.py
					...
	(2) /data/htdocs/pylibs/module_links/
	Contains symbolic links to the folder containing __init__.py for packages I want to be include-able.
	So, for example, for sqlfront/, it would include the symbolic link:
		sqlfront -> ../sqlfront/sqlfront/



=======================================================================
	Old Method of adding custom modules to pythonpath
		Pre-2014/09/02
=======================================================================
------- For All Instances of Python on this computer -------
As root, create a *.pth file for this directory/package inside the 'site-packages/' folder, or 'dist-packages/' in Debian (such as Ubuntu).
This file should contain the full path for the directory of Python scripts you wish to include.

For example:
Create: 
	/usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/custom_packages.pth
Containing the following line:
	/data/htdocs/pylibs/


Note:
	I have installed this as gdid_custom_packages.pth, to: 
		/usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/cccid_custom_packages.pth
	containing the lines:
		/data/htdocs/pylibs/
		/data/htdocs/pylibs/module_links
	Where module_links/ is a folder of symbolic links to the folders
	containing __init__.py for the packages. Necessary since:
		/data/htdocs/pylibs/unroll/
			CONTRIBUTORS.txt # and similar packaging meta-data
			...
			unroll/
				__init__.py #actual python package starts here - 1 level deep
				... 
	
------ Alternately: To set path for Apache ------
** UPDATE: I have had trouble with this, and no longer use it.cd
For all sites running through Apache:
	/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
For specific site: (ex. gdid only) 
	/etc/httpd/conf.d/SPECIFIC.conf
	ex. /etc/httpd/conf.d/gdid.conf

Inside the <VirtualHost tag, inside a <Directory tag for the directory you wish to change the PythonPath for:
Add: 
	PythonPath "['DIRECTORY']" + sys.path" 

For example, to set PythonPath for specific folder:

<VirtualHost *:80>
	#... 
	#... various additional material
	#...
	<Directory "/data/htdocs/gdid/rebuild/">
        PythonPath "['/data/htdocs/gdid/python/scratch/'] + sys.path"
    </Directory>
