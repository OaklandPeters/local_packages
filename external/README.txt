These are non-standard Python packages & libararies which I find myself using
regularly, but which I did not develop.

Hence, I am putting a copy here for easy access.

These include:

ordereddict.py: 
'OrderedDict()' became part of the standard library 'collections' 
in 2.7. This Python file provides the same functionality for Py 2.6.

aliased.py:
Provides decorators for declaring method aliases in classes.
